### Hi all 👋

I teach Computer Science at Tulane University.

- 🔭 I'm interested in proteins, math, and dnd. 
  - I have other interests too!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I spent a summer compiling my own [linux from scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/). 
  - It took a whole summer because I had alot to learn in order to do it!
