ğŸ¤“### Hi all ğŸ‘‹

I teach Computer Science at Tulane University.

- ğŸ”­ I'm interested in proteins, math, and dnd. 
  - I have other interests too!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I spent a summer compiling my own [linux from scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/). 
  - It took a whole summer because I had alot to learn in order to do it!
